    title: "Unlocking the Secrets of Git"

    speaker: Tom Preson-Werner

    desc: |
        Everyone knows that Git is the tremendously powerful distributed
        version control system created by Linus Torvalds, but did you know
        that Git is really just a userland file system with some extra goodies
        to make it work for version control? This secret life of Git allows us
        to do some insanely great things. In this talk I'll show you how Git
        works under the covers and give you a taste of what's possible when
        you understand the magic within.

        What if your server could do more?  Studies have shown that many server
        CPUs are only around 10-20% used.  This presentation is a sys admin's overview
        of Xen tools towards the goal of portable virtual machines.  We'll go over the
        features and configuration of open-source Xen and XenServer, and talk about
        what these tools can do for an organization.  If time permits, we may also
        discuss the use of Puppet for server configuration management.

        Increasing popularity of the "Third Place" (a significant space
        outside of your home and work where people congregate -- think the pub
        in _Cheers_; "Norm!"), and the incorporation of technology and telecommuting
        has lead to significant technology challenges.  Sean Reifschneider has been
        working untethered since 2000 and today tummy.com is organized such that people
        can largely work wherever they want.  In this presentation, Sean will discuss
        some of the challenges, solutions and choices that are involved with being
        untethered, yet still connected.

    title: "The Evolution of Lower Middle UNIX Userland 1985-2010"
    email: bart.massey@gmail.com
    speaker: Bart Massey
    date: 2010-09-09
    desc: |
        In about 1985 I got to use a UNIX box for the first time.  Much has
        changed; much has stayed the same.  In succeeding years, attention has focused
        on the top and bottom of the UNIX software stack.  At the bottom of the stack
        the Linux kernel, advanced device drivers, for modern hardware and X-based
        multimedia have evolved to provide a rich substrate.  Near the top of the stack
        GUIs, web services, and other high-level services attempt to provide a solid
        user experience.  Between these endpoints change has been much less swift, and
        complexity and cruft has piled up.

        In this talk I will briefly survey the 25-year evolution of the programming
        languages, libraries, and services that constitute the most basic layers of
        UNIX userland.  Along the way I will advocate several fundamental changes that
        I think are highly desirable: a better programming language, cleaner and
        simpler architectures, and better interface toolkits.  I will also report on
        some research toward achieving these goals.

    title: "Advanced File-Systems: ZFS and Btrfs"
    email: jafo@tummy.com
    speaker: Sean Reifschneider
    date: 2010-08-12
    desc: |
        While the currently-available file-systems for Linux are very stable,
        they are missing features that many other operating systems have had for
        years such as file-system snapshots.  ZFS and Btrfs offer the latest
        file-system advancements to Linux users.  Sean will discuss their
        features, benefits and drawbacks, status and stability, and provide
        demonstrations.

    title: Model-based user interfaces
    speaker: Bruce Long
    email: qstream@gmail.com
    date: 2009-07-09
    desc: |
      The modern way of 'interfacing' with our digital stuff, our friends and
      our world can be improved dramatically. Because each kind of interaction
      with someone or some data has to have its own application, and
      applications vary for each device, there are many things we do not do with
      our devices because it takes too much work. We have to remember which
      device holds what information, what format it is in, how each application
      works, which folders our stuff is in. Some years ago I was struck that it
      should be possible to make interactions with people, files, and online
      systems much much easier.  If only we could model the things we wish to
      interact with, model the devices we have, and model the kind of user
      interface we prefer. It could be so easy to interact with something in a
      new way or from a new device that we will find all kinds of new, world
      changing, things to do that previously didn't cross our mind.

      I set out to solve the problem once and for all. After a lot of C++
      coding, math learning, some paper writing, and a little PhD working, I'm
      still not there. And judging by the iPhone and the Palm Pre, no one else
      is either.  But there is a growing technology that I have heard called
      "model-based user interfaces" that has the potential to completely change
      the way we connect.  It solves the problems I worry about and much more.
      Here is a teaser: The idea is to use a model of your social infrastructure
      and information stores to make it feel more like directly connecting, in a
      sort of "make me part of a giant social brain" way to people and
      information instead of having apps and devices as intermediates limiting
      you.

      I am going to talk about some of the disruptive capabilities that
      model-based UI's will give you. Though, perhaps anticlimactic, I'll
      demonstrate my own work which is aimed at using model-based computing to
      enhance personal independence while increasing our ability to connect
      socially. I'll also talk about when we might expect results and how you
      can become a part and speed the process up!

      The talk looks at the economic relationships between free and open source

      businesses using open source software. Based on past experiences (Optaros,

      from the perspective: It's just software; It's just economics; It's just
      business; It's just software licensing. There's nothing inherently new
      about developing good software, communities, collaboration, or IP
      licensing, but the yardsticks may have changed

      One of the things about the open source community that continues to baffle
      those non-open source people is, "why do you do it?" Open source
      developers work on open source software for a number of reasons from
      scratching an itch to gaining a reputation to building a resume to
      contributing to a good cause.  The interesting problem comes when money
      enters into the equation.  Research shows that when someone works on
      something for free (for internal rewards) if you start paying them you
      replace those internal rewards. Then if you stop paying them, they will
      stop working on it.  Does that hold true for open source software?  Are
      commercial companies killing open source by paying people to work on it?

    title: Open Source Software Economics, Standards, and IP in One Lesson
    speaker: Stephen Walli
    email: stephen.walli@gmail.com
    date: 2008-09-11
    desc: |
      The talk looks at the economic relationships between free and open source
      software, standards and intellectual property, and how they relate to
      businesses using open source software. Based on past experiences (Optaros,
      Microsoft, Softway, MKS), it looks at open source software in business
      from the perspective: It's just software; It's just economics; It's just
      business; It's just software licensing. There's nothing inherently new
      about developing good software, communities, collaboration, or IP
      licensing, but the yardsticks may have changed

    title: Are commercial companies killing open source by paying people to work on it?
    speaker: Stormy Peters
    email: speters@openlogic.com
    date: 2008-05-08
    desc: |
      One of the things about the open source community that continues to baffle
      those non-open source people is, "why do you do it?" Open source
      developers work on open source software for a number of reasons from
      scratching an itch to gaining a reputation to building a resume to
      contributing to a good cause.  The interesting problem comes when money
      enters into the equation.  Research shows that when someone works on
      something for free (for internal rewards) if you start paying them you
      replace those internal rewards. Then if you stop paying them, they will
      stop working on it.  Does that hold true for open source software?  Are
      commercial companies killing open source by paying people to work on it?

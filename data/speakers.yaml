      Python is a popular programming language whose design philosophy
      emphasizes code readability. If used naively it is not fast. However,
      various techniques have been schemed to prevent the problem. This talk
      with discuss some of these techniques with their pros and cons.

    title: "Achieving In vivo Robotic Capsule Mobility"

      The state-of-the-art technology for deep gastrointestinal (GI) tract
      exploration is a capsule endoscope (CE). Capsule endoscopes are pill-sized
      devices that provide visual feedback of the GI tract as they move
      passively through the patient. These passive devices could benefit from a
      mobility system enabling maneuverability and controllability. Potential
      benefits of a robotic capsule endoscope (RCE) include faster travel
      speeds, ability to maintain an anchored position, reaction force
      generation for biopsy, and decreased capsule retention. To achieve in vivo
      robotic mobility we have studied the design, experimental testing
      performance, contact mechanics, and robotic implementation of
      micro-patterned treads. In this talk, our approach to achieving in vivo
      robotic mobility is presented. This includes experimental test methods,
      devices, and results for the mechanical characterization of
      micro-patterned treads designs, in regards to tread-tissue traction and
      adhesion generation. Mechanics modeling of robot-tissue contact mechanics
      is also presented. The talk is concluded by discussing design and
      integration of these treads into a novel robotic capsule endoscope for
      active mobility in the gastrointestinal tract with in vivo testing results
      on a porcine model presented.

      Illustrating my urge to turn silk purses into sow's ears, I will apply
      cryptography to DNA, and reach a conclusion that Sidney Brenner and Francis
      Crick came to fifty years ago through real, molecular biology experiments.

      Of course, they were Nobel laureates so they knew what they were doing.

      This talk is from an article, which I wrote and got paid for, yet wound up
      unpublished because 9/11 took the magazine under.

    title: "Yellowstone, the New Linux-based supercomputer at NCAR."
    speaker: David Del Vento
    date: 2012-11-08
    desc: |
      Yellowstone is the latest NCAR's supercomputer and it marks many changes
      for supercomputing at NCAR. As always it's the largest machine to date to
      be deployed at NCAR, but it's using "commodity technology" such as x86
      processors and Linux which are unusual entries for supercomputing at NCAR.
      Of course a supercomputer can't be "just" commodity, so there are many
      hardware and software tricks that Yellowstone has in its sleeves, and that
      this talk will unveil some. Four software "tricks" may be useful to normal
      Linux deployment, so you may learn something good to know even if you
      don't run a supercomputer. The building accommodating the machine is also
      brand new, and using the latest and greatest technology itself, so I will
      describe them too.

      Late last year I somehow managed to haul myself out of bed before 7am on
      a Saturday and attend a Code Retreat.  We spent the day, except for a
      lunch break, splitting into groups of 2 or 3 people and spend 30 minutes
      experimenting with developing software.  At the end of the 30 minutes
      you delete the progress so far and start over with a new group.
      The goal is that you should not be able to complete the program, but
      instead you should concentrate on software development best practices
      such as testing, documentation, pair-programming, and even refactoring
      came into play.
      In this talk I will talk about my experiences at my first Code Retreat
      and how it has impacted my software development since.

    desc: |
      AppInventor, a Google project, is a visual programming environment for
      developing applications for Android devices.

      It has been around for about a year, and has been most enthusiastically
      adopted as a programming education tool.

      I'm going to do a demonstration of using AppInventor to create a tiny
      Android App, including all of the setup you will need to do on your current
      Linux system to use it. I'll also discuss the changes that are happening
      within the AppInventor ecosystem.

      This talk is suitable for people who are looking for a way to introduce
      non-programmers to programming on Android, or for those interested in
      visual programming. It will NOT be an overly technical talk, so I would
      encourage you to bring your favorite novice along.

    speaker: Tom Cargill
    date: 2011-07-14
    desc: |
        The power of a quantum computer can far exceed that of a classical
        computer, at least in theory.  This power derives from the
        characteristics of the "qubit," the quantum analog of the classical bit.
        Typical descriptions of the qubit assume a math background beyond that of
        typical programmers.  I will offer an accurate, but unconventional, description
        of the qubit in terms familiar to most programmers -- common data structures
        and algorithms.  This description will convey the nature of quantum computing's
        power.

    title: "EXT File System Forensics"
    email: hal@deer-run.com
    speaker: Hal Pomeranz
    date: 2011-06-09
    desc: |
        The classic problem with recovering deleted data in modern Linux EXT
        file systems is that when inode meta-data structures are reallocated,
        the block pointer information in these structures is zeroed.  This
        makes direct reassembly of the original file extremely difficult.

        File-carving techniques (foremost, scalpel, et al) can sometimes be
        used when the target file has well-defined start and end signatures.
        However, many common Linux file formats lack these signatures or have
        no well-defined end of file marker-- e.g., compressed or gzip data,
        tar archives, and so on.  Also, these file-carving techniques can run
        afoul of meta-data information-- indirect block pointers-- embedded in
        the block stream of larger files.  When this meta-data information is
        naively incorporated into the recovered data blocks, the usual result
        is a corrupted and unreadable file.  Traditional file-carving tools
        simply "work around" (skip) indirect block data with varying degrees
        of success.  But simply skipping this indirect block metadata misses
        out on a golden opportunity to easily recover most or all of the
        original file.

        The presentation will begin with an overview of EXT file systems and
        the indirect block pointer mechanism.  The limitations of existing
        file carving tools will be demonstrated.  Then we will use existing
        and newly developed tools to detect indirect blocks to manually
        recover file data from an actual file system.  Time permitting,
        we'll look into the newer EXT4 file system and discuss issues that
        will complicate forensics on newer Linux systems.

    title: "Resistance is Futile - Easy to use cloud-scale monitoring with the Assimilation Monitoring project"
    email: alanr@unix.sh
    speaker: Alan Robertson
    date: 2011-03-10
    desc: |
        The Assimilation monitoring project is a new open source data center
        monitoring project designed to be easy to install and configure, and scale
        to tens of thousands of servers.

        It employs a new O(1) server monitoring method, and implements a "no news
        is good news" policy.  Most systems will run a centrally-configured
        low-overhead nanoprobe, which report back only when problems occur.  A small
        number of systems (NetApps, UPSes, and so on) cannot run the probe software,
        and will be monitored by the other systems with nanoprobes - distributing
        out the monitoring load evenly across these other systems.

        These nanoprobes discover local server configuration, local switch
        configuration and the presence of other servers in the network - avoiding
        using security-unfriendly port scanning or similar techniques.

        Another novel aspect of the system is that in addition to being highly
        scalable in terms of maximum size, it is highly network-topology aware -
        with less than 1% of traffic going outside the local (top of rack or other)
        switches.
        This project is at a early development stage with about 6500
        well-documented lines of code currently written.  It is expected to be
        usable in early production sites in the next few months.

    desc: |
        In about 1985 I got to use a UNIX box for the first time.  Much has
        changed; much has stayed the same.  In succeeding years, attention has focused
        on the top and bottom of the UNIX software stack.  At the bottom of the stack
        the Linux kernel, advanced device drivers, for modern hardware and X-based
        multimedia have evolved to provide a rich substrate.  Near the top of the stack
        GUIs, web services, and other high-level services attempt to provide a solid
        user experience.  Between these endpoints change has been much less swift, and
        complexity and cruft has piled up.

        In this talk I will briefly survey the 25-year evolution of the programming
        languages, libraries, and services that constitute the most basic layers of
        UNIX userland.  Along the way I will advocate several fundamental changes that
        I think are highly desirable: a better programming language, cleaner and
        simpler architectures, and better interface toolkits.  I will also report on
        some research toward achieving these goals.

      Google's new Android platform is Linux, but not as you know Linux.  And it
      is Java, but not Sun's Java.  Come get an overview of how it is different,
      what you can do with it, how open it really is, and where it is going.
      Besides many mobile phones in the pipeline, there are announcements of
      devices like GPS, netbook, media players, etc.  We'll also quickly discuss
      using Java or Ajax/HTML5 for development, and hopefully whet your interest

    title: Model-based user interfaces
    speaker: Bruce Long
    email: qstream@gmail.com
    date: 2009-07-09
    desc: |
      The modern way of 'interfacing' with our digital stuff, our friends and
      our world can be improved dramatically. Because each kind of interaction
      with someone or some data has to have its own application, and
      applications vary for each device, there are many things we do not do with
      our devices because it takes too much work. We have to remember which
      device holds what information, what format it is in, how each application
      works, which folders our stuff is in. Some years ago I was struck that it
      should be possible to make interactions with people, files, and online
      systems much much easier.  If only we could model the things we wish to
      interact with, model the devices we have, and model the kind of user
      interface we prefer. It could be so easy to interact with something in a
      new way or from a new device that we will find all kinds of new, world
      changing, things to do that previously didn't cross our mind.

      I set out to solve the problem once and for all. After a lot of C++
      coding, math learning, some paper writing, and a little PhD working, I'm
      still not there. And judging by the iPhone and the Palm Pre, no one else
      is either.  But there is a growing technology that I have heard called
      "model-based user interfaces" that has the potential to completely change
      the way we connect.  It solves the problems I worry about and much more.
      Here is a teaser: The idea is to use a model of your social infrastructure
      and information stores to make it feel more like directly connecting, in a
      sort of "make me part of a giant social brain" way to people and
      information instead of having apps and devices as intermediates limiting
      you.

      I am going to talk about some of the disruptive capabilities that
      model-based UI's will give you. Though, perhaps anticlimactic, I'll
      demonstrate my own work which is aimed at using model-based computing to
      enhance personal independence while increasing our ability to connect
      socially. I'll also talk about when we might expect results and how you
      can become a part and speed the process up!

      from the perspective: It's just software; It's just economics; It's just
      business; It's just software licensing. There's nothing inherently new
      about developing good software, communities, collaboration, or IP
      licensing, but the yardsticks may have changed

    desc: |
      One of the things about the open source community that continues to baffle
      those non-open source people is, "why do you do it?" Open source
      developers work on open source software for a number of reasons from
      scratching an itch to gaining a reputation to building a resume to
      contributing to a good cause.  The interesting problem comes when money
      enters into the equation.  Research shows that when someone works on
      something for free (for internal rewards) if you start paying them you
      replace those internal rewards. Then if you stop paying them, they will
      stop working on it.  Does that hold true for open source software?  Are
      commercial companies killing open source by paying people to work on it?
